# Preface {-}

(Generic cover image)

```{r cover, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("images/cover.png")
```

```{r meta-setup, echo=FALSE}
# use_glossary() # set up glossary
# initTaxonomy() # tags
```

## Overview {-}

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

## Helpful tips {-}

1. I've added a `setup.R` script in the '_bookdown.yml' file to run before each chapter (as each chapter starts neew). I've also loaded some key libraries and set some general options for code chunks and figures. 
2. You can run the `bookdown::serve_book()` function to set up a live preview situation. 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'tidyverse'
), 'latex/packages.bib')
```

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

# Introduction {#intro}

```{block, type="tip"}
Here is a tip!
```

> Working on glossary and taxonomy via `indexr`

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(chapter2).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. *Note: to maintain figures in their position in latex use the `fig.pos = 'H'` parameter and value.*

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!'}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure, group = 1)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 3)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). *Note: to have tables span across multiple pages, if necessary, in PDF, use the `longtable = TRUE` argument for `kable()`. You will also need to have the `\usepackage{longtable}` in the latex preamble.*

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

Here's the spanning version. 

```{r nice-span-tab}
knitr::kable(head(iris, 20), 
             caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
             booktabs = TRUE, 
             longtable = TRUE)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

<!-- SECOND CHAPTER -->

# Second chapter {#chapter2}

Here is a review of existing methods.

```{block, type="note"}
Hello world. I'm a note. If the note is longer it will expand. 

- Hello
- World

```


**NOTE:** I've included the chapters in a single .Rmd document. This is so that this template can be forked and only the minimal components will be included. A typical bookdown project will have numerous .Rmd files corresponding to book parts and/or chapters. I've left the taxonomies, glossary, and references files as they are part of the scaffolding for this template. 

# Third chapter {#chapter3}

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.
